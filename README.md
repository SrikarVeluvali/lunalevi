## LUNA

LUNA - Stands for Logical User-friendly Navigation Assistant is an AI powered Navigation Assistant. It performs many functions like opening websites, answer queries and also check internet speed, play music, remember stuff.

## LEVI

LEVI - Stands for Langugae Enabled Virtual Intelligence is same like LUNA but is text-based. It is basically for people who are shy to speak to an AI? (idk how that works but ok)

Read the documentation for each assistant in their respective folders
