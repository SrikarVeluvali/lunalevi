# LUNA and LEVI
----

## LUNA

LUNA - Stands for Logical User-friendly Navigation Assistant is an AI powered Navigation Assistant. It performs many functions like opening websites, answer queries and also check internet speed, play music, remember stuff.

## LEVI

LEVI - Stands for Langugae Enabled Virtual Intelligence is same like LUNA but is text-based. It is basically for people who are shy to speak to an AI? (idk how that works but ok)

These two are not working anymore as my OpenAI key has expired, but if you have an openai key, put it in the code and watch it work!
